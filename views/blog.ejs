                <p>I began my programming journey right after graduating from high school. My first step into this exciting world was enrolling in <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/" target="_blank" aria-label="CS50 Python Course">Harvard's CS50 Python course</a>. It was a fantastic introduction that gave me a solid foundation, and I spent countless hours solving problem sets, which helped me sharpen my problem-solving skills.</p>
                <p>When I joined university, I quickly realized that learning programming goes far beyond attending lectures and completing small projects. <span class="highlight">True mastery comes from hands-on experience and working on multiple projects.</span> Each project taught me something new and deepened my understanding of programming concepts.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Databases</strong>: I learned how databases work and understood their critical role in organizing and managing data effectively. This knowledge opened my eyes to the importance of data in almost every field today.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Structures and Algorithms</strong>: This subject challenged my logical thinking and problem-solving abilities. It taught me how to write efficient and optimized codeâ€”a skill essential for any programmer.</li>
                    <li><strong>Blockchain Technology</strong>: Understanding how blockchain works was both fascinating and eye-opening. It's incredible to see how this technology is revolutionizing industries and shaping the future.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mathematics</strong>: Programming and math go hand in hand. I've worked through various mathematical concepts that have strengthened my ability to write better algorithms and solve complex problems.</li>
                </ul>
                <blockquote>
                    "Currently, I am exploring the world of Web Development. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has been exciting as well as Node.js and Express.js."
                </blockquote>
                <p>This journey hasn't been easy, but it has been incredibly rewarding. Each step, from Python to web development, has shaped my skills and given me confidence. I know there is much more to learn, and I am ready to face the challenges ahead. Because in the end, I believe in myself, and I know I can do this.</p>
